# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through severals levels of FreeCodeCourse.com. 

**Thoughts:** So far, I feel like all of this is a refresher of what I have already learned. It's great getting to refresh what I know in a quick crash sort kind of way.

### Day 2: April 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
